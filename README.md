# Personal Values Survey

For 30 years people have used a Personal Values Questionnaire which ranks a person’s answers into 10 specific value groups which helps an individual discover much about the values which matter most to them. Common Cause Australia aims to bring this questionnaire to the general public in a format reflective of the times. It has requested that an ANU Tech launcher team assist in the development of a website which provides the functionality of the questionnaire in an easily accessible and visually appealing format.
